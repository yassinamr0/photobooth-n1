# Drydock

Lay the keel of the **shipyard**: one repo, one shared harness, every contributor inherits it. This skill scaffolds the environment that turns "everyone ships" into "everyone ships on the same design language" — it creates the 5 surfaces, seeds them minimally, wires them to the flows that fill them (launch writes CONTEXT/ADR; the launch C5 sediment pass and reviews sediment standards), and reports what exists, what was created, and what stays empty on purpose.

The four pillars and where they physically live:

| Pillar | Surfaces |
|---|---|
| Context (shared background) | `CONTEXT.md` (glossary) + `docs/business/` + `docs/adr/` + OMC wiki |
| Rules (boundaries) | `CLAUDE.md` (thin entry: conventions, principles, index) + `docs/standards/` |
| Tools (composable capability) | `.omc/skills/` + `.mcp.json` + `scripts/` |
| Standards (the classification society) | `design-system/` (tokens, components, patterns) + `docs/standards/` |

Metaphor map: the shipyard is the shared facility; the classification society (`docs/standards/` + `design-system/`) sets the rules a ship must pass to be seaworthy; drydock lays the keel; launch ships it.

## When to Use

- starting a repo that humans and agents will both build on
- a repo where knowledge lives in people's heads and chat history instead of files
- onboarding: a new teammate or agent should inherit context by reading, not by asking

## When Not to Use

- throwaway prototypes with no collaborators
- a repo already running this harness (use `--check` instead)

## Workflow

### 1. Detect (never clobber)

Inventory what exists before writing anything:

- `CLAUDE.md` present? `AGENTS.md` present? (rule: if either exists, extend it in place; create the missing one as a one-line pointer to the other; **never create both fresh**)
- `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/standards/`, `docs/business/`, `design-system/`, `.omc/skills/`, `.mcp.json`, `scripts/`, `.gitattributes` — which exist, which are missing?
- OMC installed? — only worth checking when running inside an OMC session; outside one, skip this check silently (the harness works with or without OMC)

Report the map first, then act.

### 2. Resolve document language, then ask only what detection cannot answer

The document language for the generated harness files is a file-backed decision, not conversation state. Use this contract exactly:

<!-- shipyard-document-language-contract:start -->
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "authority": { "path": "CONTEXT.md", "frontmatterKey": "documentLanguage" },
  "canonicalSources": ["CLAUDE.md", "README.md"],
  "askOn": ["missing", "mixed", "conflict", "low-confidence", "invalid-explicit", "script-ambiguous"],
  "tagPattern": "^[a-z]{2,3}(?:-[A-Z][a-z]{3})?(?:-(?:[A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?$",
  "scriptVariants": ["zh-Hans", "zh-Hant"],
  "seedCompanionPrefixes": { "en": "en", "zh-Hans": "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant": "zh-Hant" },
  "stableTokens": [
    "CONTEXT.md", "documentLanguage", "/oh-my-claudecode:launch", "--serial",
    "plan", "execute", "review", "verify", "blockedBy", "blocked_by",
    "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "failed", "ready-for-agent",
    "id", "name", "description", "triggers", "mcpServers", "```",
    "<Project>", "<term>", "<feature-slug>"
  ]
}
```
<!-- shipyard-document-language-contract:end -->

Resolution order:

1. An explicit human choice in the current invocation wins when valid. Normalize it to a stable BCP-47-style tag: lowercase language, Title-Case script, uppercase region. Invalid explicit input must be asked once rather than guessed.
2. Otherwise, read `documentLanguage` from the YAML frontmatter at the top of `CONTEXT.md`. A valid, script-unambiguous tag is authoritative for fresh Drydock and Launch invocations. If the persisted tag is bare or region-only Chinese, ask once at this authority tier; never bypass it with source inference.
3. If the marker is absent or invalid, inspect canonical sources in this order: `CLAUDE.md`, then `README.md`. Infer only when every usable source has one unambiguous dominant language and all usable sources agree on the same normalized tag. One unambiguous source is sufficient when the other is missing or empty.
4. Chinese must resolve to an explicit script-qualified tag: `zh-Hans` or `zh-Hant` (optionally followed by a region). Bare `zh` and region-only Chinese tags are script-ambiguous and must be asked once rather than selecting a companion. Companion selection uses the longest language/script prefix: `zh-Hans-*` selects the `zh-Hans` companion and `zh-Hant-*` selects `zh-Hant`; preserve the full normalized tag (for example `zh-Hans-CN`) in `CONTEXT.md`.
5. Missing usable sources, mixed-language content, conflicting tags, low-confidence inference, invalid explicit input, or script-ambiguous Chinese must trigger one batched language question. Do not guess. If no answer is available, stop before writing localized artifacts.
6. Before scaffolding, write the resolved tag to the exact stable frontmatter key `documentLanguage` in `CONTEXT.md` (creating or extending its frontmatter without translating the key). This visible file is the init report's language authority; no daemon, hidden ledger, or runtime state is created.

Only prose and human-facing labels/localizable values follow the selected language; structural keys stay language-stable. Keep paths, slash commands, flags, code fences, placeholders, frontmatter keys and machine-semantic values, YAML/JSON keys, lifecycle tokens, status enums, IDs, `blockedBy`, public Team `blocked_by`, and parser/control tokens byte-for-byte stable.

Ask the remaining questions only after language is resolved:

- package/tech stack (for standards and design-system seeds)
- does this repo have a UI? (no UI → design-system/ is created as a stub with a note, or skipped on request)
- issue tracker location (GitHub / GitLab / local `.scratch/`) — for V1 harbor intake only GitHub is supported; also record the maintainer's communication authority for intake (issue comments, label changes) — consumed by the navigator's map home and the harbor's intake queue

### 3. Scaffold (create missing surfaces — seeds render in the document language)

```
CLAUDE.md                      # thin entry — see seed A
CONTEXT.md                     # glossary — see seed B
.gitattributes                 # * text=auto eol=lf  (kills CRLF warning noise on Windows)
docs/adr/0001-adopt-shipyard-harness.md
docs/standards/architecture.md # seed C
docs/standards/data.md
docs/standards/process.md
docs/business/README.md        # seed D
design-system/README.md        # seed E (UI repos only; stub otherwise)
design-system/tokens/README.md
.omc/skills/README.md          # seed F
.mcp.json                      # {"mcpServers": {}}
scripts/README.md
```

Seed exemplars are reference companions, never a combined payload. Select exactly one companion after resolving `documentLanguage`; do not emit duplicate headings or labels from another companion. Use the longest matching language/script prefix: `en-*` uses English, `zh-Hans-*` uses Simplified Chinese, and `zh-Hant-*` uses Traditional Chinese, while Seed B writes the full resolved tag into `documentLanguage`. For any other valid tag, translate the English canonical companion once while preserving every stable token above.

Before generating seed prose, call the Skill tool with `agent-doc-discipline` and apply its rules; seed prose is ready only when every rule is checkable and carries a why, every surface is self-describing without chat history, and sources are named rather than assumed. A teammate or agent should be able to act on the seed's content by reading alone.

Seed C — docs/standards/architecture.md (data.md same shape; process.md additionally seeds a Testing volume — see Seed C2; prose renders in the document language):

```markdown
# Architecture Standards

Rule-shaped, checkable writing; every rule carries a "why". Empty sections are legal — sediment is gradual.

## Module boundaries
## Error handling
## Dependency direction
## Seams and depth

- A seam is a real boundary two modules already cross in both directions. One adapter is a hypothetical seam; two adapters make it real. (Checkable: count the callers. Why: speculative abstraction is a tax paid before the need exists.)
- A deep module puts much behavior behind a small interface; deepen before widening. (Why: the interface is the permanent tax.)
- Logic lives behind the seam that owns its data; stable dependencies point inward. (Why: logic that reaches across a boundary it does not own couples every caller to the wrong neighbor.)
```

Seed C2 — docs/standards/process.md, Testing volume (rendered when the repo tests code; prose renders in the document language):

```markdown
## Testing

- Tests enter through the interface only: assert observable behavior at the seam. Reaching past the seam — querying the store directly, reading internal state — is false confidence. (Why: a test that survives refactors describes behavior, not plumbing.)
- Expected values come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal or a worked example from the spec. (Why: a test that recomputes its expectation the way the code does can never disagree with the code.)
- One slice at a time: one failing test, one minimal implementation, repeat. Bulk-writing all tests first tests the imagination, not the behavior. (Why: the loop is a feedback engine; batching cuts the feedback.)
- Refactoring happens at the review axis, not inside the red-green loop. (Why: the loop answers "is the behavior right"; mixing redesign in hides regressions.)
- Tests open only at seams the reviewing captain approved. (Why: unapproved seams spend effort where the risk is not.)
```

Seed D — docs/business/README.md:

```markdown
# Business Knowledge

Decision background and business rules. Format suggestion: one article answers one business question, opening paragraph states why it matters.

```

```markdown
# Design System

## components/ Component contracts (purpose, variants, misuse)
## patterns/  Interaction patterns (forms, feedback, loading, empty states — sediment reused patterns)
```

Seed F — .omc/skills/README.md:

````markdown
# Project Skills

Reusable capabilities sedimented by this project: specialized tools, prompt templates, specialized practices.
One skill per file `.omc/skills/<name>.md`, frontmatter must contain a stable ASCII `id` plus name + description +
**non-empty triggers** (loader validation hard requirement: missing or empty means the skill is never loaded):

```markdown
---
id: project-release-check
name: project-release-check
description: Apply this repository's release readiness rules
triggers:
  - "project release check"
---

# Project Release Check

Follow the repository-specific release checklist and report evidence.
```
The literal YAML keys `id`, `name`, `description`, and `triggers` never localize. `id` and other machine-semantic values stay ASCII and stable; the scalar display values for `name`, `description`, and `triggers`, plus Markdown headings and prose, may localize. A non-Latin display name remains loadable because the explicit ASCII `id` is stable.
Bar for admission matches skillify: if it can be Googled in 5 minutes it is not a skill;
write "this project's specific decision discipline", not generic tutorials.
````

`.mcp.json` seed: `{"mcpServers": {}}` — servers get added when a tool integration is actually needed, not speculatively.

**Destructive-operation guardrail preset.** On request, drydock seeds a hook preset that blocks destructive git operations — push, force-push, hard reset, clean, and branch deletion — behind explicit approval. It is installed as ordinary, inspectable repo config (a hooks entry the repo can read and audit — the same place the repo's other hooks live, e.g. the agent harness's settings hooks or a git pre-push hook), never a hidden enforcement layer: the rules are listed in the report, and removing the entry is an explicit human act. The preset protects the laid harness, not the agent — no agent session can end the repo's history by accident. Seed shape:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "command": "<confirm-before-destructive-git>",
        "description": "Block push, force-push, reset --hard, clean, and branch -D behind explicit approval"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The matcher and command are the repo's own choice of hook mechanism — drydock seeds the shape and the rule list, and the confirmation command lives in the Tools pillar (`scripts/`) where the repo can read and audit it.

**Commit-time quality gate preset.** On request, drydock also seeds a commit-time hook preset that runs the repo's own checks before a commit lands — lint, typecheck, and the test suite, each wired to whatever entrypoints the repo already has (the Tools pillar's `scripts/`, the package manager's standard commands). Same shape as the guardrail preset: ordinary, inspectable repo config, listed in the report, removable only by an explicit human act. The gates are the repo's existing checks wired to the commit boundary — drydock adds no new checker of its own, and a repo without established check commands gets the scaffold with the commands left for the humans to name.

### 4. Wire the governance loop (this is what makes it a shipyard, not a folder)

Tell the user, and rely on these flows to fill the skeleton:

- **launch** writes CONTEXT.md vocabulary, ADRs, and docs/business/ as decisions settle (paper trail)
- **launch C5 sediment / code-review** sediment recurring corrections into docs/standards/ and CLAUDE.md principles
- **anyone** can add a project skill to .omc/skills/ — the barrier is the skillify quality gate, not permission
- **wiki** (OMC) compounds session knowledge; promote anything referenced twice into docs/business/

The rule that keeps 先动手 aligned: **starting needs no permission; landing goes into a shipyard slot.** A change that cannot say which slot it lands in (or explicitly none) is the smell.

### 5. Report

- created / extended / deliberately skipped (each with why)
- resolved document language as `CONTEXT.md` frontmatter `documentLanguage: <tag>`, including whether it came from explicit choice, the persisted marker, or unanimous inference
- the 3 surfaces that most need human content next (usually CLAUDE.md conventions, architecture.md, CONTEXT.md first terms)
- reminder: re-run with `--check` any time to see drift between filesystem and harness

## `--check` mode

Diff actual repo state against the shipyard map; report: missing surfaces, a missing or invalid `CONTEXT.md` frontmatter `documentLanguage` tag, CLAUDE.md sections that point at dead paths, CONTEXT.md terms unused in code, and standards never referenced. For each finding, state the confidence (`high` when mechanically checkable, `low` when heuristic) and whether it is actionable after excluding throwaway/scratch repositories explicitly declared by the user. Launch's yard gate treats high-confidence actionable findings as blocking; low-confidence or explicitly-classified false-positive findings, and findings in a user-declared scratch/throwaway scope, may be overridden only with deliberate per-invocation intent (see `/oh-my-claudecode:launch`). `/oh-my-claudecode:ask-navigator` may also run this audit in report-only mode while charting a foggy effort: findings are recorded verbatim in the map's Notes (never swallowed) and remain live findings for the launch yard gate.

**The structured exit contract.** The mechanical subset of this audit is executable: `node scripts/shipyard-audit.mjs [repoRoot]` checks the high-confidence classes only — missing surfaces, a missing/invalid `documentLanguage` tag, dead paths in `CLAUDE.md`, project-skill triggers present, and intent statuses within the documented vocabulary — and emits JSON on stdout (human summary on stderr) in the same finding vocabulary the lookout CLI uses: `severity` (high/medium/low/info), `confidence` (high/low), `actionable`, plus a stable finding id, evidence, and advice. Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = high-confidence actionable findings present, 2 = invocation error. The heuristic classes (terms unused in code, standards never referenced) stay in this prose layer by design — they are `low`-confidence by construction and the script never invents findings it cannot verify mechanically. Read-only.
