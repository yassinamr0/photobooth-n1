# Team Skill

Spawn N coordinated agents working on a shared task list using Claude Code's implicit agent team. Claude Code 2.1.178+ removed native `TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete`; with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, each session has one implicit team and teammates are spawned directly with the Agent/Task tool using distinct `name` values. This skill still preserves OMC's legacy tmux/CLI worker orchestration where documented (`omc team` / `/omc-teams`). The implicit team and `omc team` do not share a result: one finishing does not make the other succeed.

The `swarm` compatibility alias was removed in #1131.

## Usage

```
/oh-my-claudecode:team N:agent-type "task description"
/oh-my-claudecode:team "task description"
/oh-my-claudecode:team ralph "task description"
```

### Parameters

- **N** - Number of teammate agents (1-20). Optional; defaults to auto-sizing based on task decomposition.
- **agent-type** - OMC agent to spawn for the `team-exec` stage (e.g., executor, debugger, designer, codex, gemini, antigravity). Optional; defaults to stage-aware routing. Use `codex` to spawn Codex CLI workers, `gemini` for Gemini CLI workers (enterprise/API-key tier), or `antigravity` for Antigravity CLI (`agy`) workers (Google's successor to the Gemini CLI; requires respective CLIs installed). See Stage Agent Routing below.
- **task** - High-level task to decompose and distribute among teammates
- **ralph** - Optional modifier. When present, wraps the team pipeline in Ralph's persistence loop (retry on failure, architect verification before completion). See Team + Ralph Composition below.

### Examples

```bash
/team 5:executor "fix all TypeScript errors across the project"
/team 3:debugger "fix build errors in src/"
/team 4:designer "implement responsive layouts for all page components"
/team "refactor the auth module with security review"
/team ralph "build a complete REST API for user management"
# With Codex CLI workers (requires: npm install -g @openai/codex)
/team 2:codex "review architecture and suggest improvements"
# With Gemini CLI workers (requires: npm install -g @google/gemini-cli)
/team 2:gemini "redesign the UI components"
# With Antigravity CLI workers (requires: install per https://antigravity.google)
/team 2:antigravity "redesign the UI components"
# Mixed: Codex for backend analysis, Gemini/Antigravity for frontend (delegate per-task with /oh-my-claudecode:ask)
```

                      -> preserve shared/legacy state for explicit --all cleanup
```

**Native Claude Code team model (2.1.178+):**

```
- No per-team ~/.claude/teams/<name>/ directory is created by this skill.
- No TeamCreate/TeamDelete calls are available.
- `team_name` is accepted by native Claude Code only as ignored legacy metadata; do not rely on it for routing.
- Spawn teammates directly via Agent/Task with `name="worker-N"`.
```

## Goal Workflow Relationship

Team is the OMC authority for parallel, staged execution. Use the deterministic conflict policies `refuse`, `adopt_existing`, and `artifact_only` rather than non-deterministic warning handling. If a task mentions Claude Code `/goal`, Ralph, or artifact-only Ultragoal, keep Team as the primary loop authority unless the leader explicitly hands off. Use `/goal` only as a documented native Claude Code handoff target or as visible evidence from the lead session; do not claim the `/goal` evaluator independently runs commands, reads files, or replaces `team-verify` / `team-fix`. Artifact-only Ultragoal references should be treated as durable goal ledger/checkpoint/evidence artifacts, not as worker execution by themselves.

## Staged Pipeline (Canonical Team Runtime)

Team execution follows a staged pipeline:

`team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix (loop)`

### Stage Agent Routing

Each pipeline stage uses **specialized agents** -- not just executors. The lead selects agents based on the stage and task characteristics.

| Stage           | Required Agents                     | Optional Agents                                                                                         | Selection Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **team-plan**   | `explore` (haiku), `planner` (opus) | `analyst` (opus), `architect` (opus)                                                                    | Use `analyst` for unclear requirements. Use `architect` for systems with complex boundaries.                                                                                                      |
| **team-prd**    | `analyst` (opus)                    | `critic` (opus)                                                                                         | Use `critic` to challenge scope.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **team-exec**   | `executor` (sonnet)                 | `executor` (opus), `debugger` (sonnet), `designer` (sonnet), `writer` (haiku), `test-engineer` (sonnet) | Match agent to subtask type. Use `executor` (model=opus) for complex autonomous work, `designer` for UI, `debugger` for compilation issues, `writer` for docs, `test-engineer` for test creation. |
| **team-verify** | `verifier` (sonnet)                 | `test-engineer` (sonnet), `security-reviewer` (sonnet), `code-reviewer` (opus)                          | Always run `verifier`. Add `security-reviewer` for auth/crypto changes. Add `code-reviewer` for >20 files or architectural changes. `code-reviewer` also covers style/formatting checks.          |
| **team-fix**    | `executor` (sonnet)                 | `debugger` (sonnet), `executor` (opus)                                                                  | Use `debugger` for type/build errors and regression isolation. Use `executor` (model=opus) for complex multi-file fixes.                                                                          |

**Routing rules:**

1. **The lead picks agents per stage, not the user.** The user's `N:agent-type` parameter only overrides the `team-exec` stage worker type. All other stages use stage-appropriate specialists.
2. **Specialist agents complement executor agents.** Route analysis/review to architect/critic Claude agents and UI work to designer agents. Tmux CLI workers do not participate in Claude's native team messaging.
3. **Cost mode affects model tier.** In downgrade: `opus` agents to `sonnet`, `sonnet` to `haiku` where quality permits. `team-verify` always uses at least `sonnet`.
4. **Risk level escalates review.** Security-sensitive or >20 file changes must include `security-reviewer` + `code-reviewer` (opus) in `team-verify`.

### Stage Entry/Exit Criteria

- **team-plan**
  - Entry: Team invocation is parsed and orchestration starts.
  - Agents: `explore` scans codebase, `planner` creates task graph, optionally `analyst`/`architect` for complex tasks.
  - Exit: decomposition is complete and a runnable task graph is prepared.
- **team-prd**
  - Entry: scope is ambiguous or acceptance criteria are missing.
  - Agents: `analyst` extracts requirements, optionally `critic`.
  - Exit: acceptance criteria and boundaries are explicit.
- **team-exec**
  - Entry: task list assignment and worker spawn are complete.
  - Agents: workers spawned as the appropriate specialist type per subtask (see routing table).
  - Exit: execution tasks reach terminal state for the current pass.
- **team-verify**
  - Entry: execution pass finishes.
  - Agents: `verifier` + task-appropriate reviewers (see routing table).
  - Exit (pass): verification gates pass with no required follow-up.
  - Exit (fail): fix tasks are generated and control moves to `team-fix`.
- **team-fix**
  - Entry: verification found defects/regressions/incomplete criteria.
  - Agents: `executor`/`debugger` depending on defect type.
  - Exit: fixes are complete and flow returns to `team-exec` then `team-verify`.

### Verify/Fix Loop and Stop Conditions

Continue `team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix` until:

1. verification passes and no required fix tasks remain, or
2. work reaches an explicit terminal blocked/failed outcome with evidence.

`team-fix` is bounded by max attempts. If fix attempts exceed the configured limit, transition to terminal `failed` (no infinite loop).

**Run closeout (either terminal outcome).** Before `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` state cleanup, append at most three factual lines to `.omc/notepads/team/problems.md` (blockers additionally in `.omc/notepads/team/issues.md`) — what broke (defects that survived a fix round, three-strike halts) and what dragged (worker environment friction, missing checks, unreachable information). Preserve existing entries: append only and never replace the shared file. If there are no observations, append nothing; an empty closeout is valid, so do not write “no lessons.” Observations only; landing them on repo surfaces is `refit`'s job, with the user's approval. For a terminal `failed` outcome, also draft an incident work item with the failure signature, evidence pointers, and reopen path; append it to the local `.omc/notepads/team/issues.md`. Post it to a tracker only when the user or mode invocation explicitly authorizes that external action.

### Stage Handoff Convention

When transitioning between stages, important context — decisions made, alternatives rejected, risks identified — lives only in the lead's conversation history. If the lead's context compacts or agents restart, this knowledge is lost.

**Each completing stage MUST produce a handoff document before transitioning.**

The lead writes handoffs to `.omc/handoffs/<stage-name>.md`.

#### Handoff Format

```markdown
## Handoff: <current-stage> → <next-stage>

- **Decided**: [key decisions made in this stage]
- **Rejected**: [alternatives considered and why they were rejected]
- **Risks**: [identified risks for the next stage]
- **Files**: [key files created or modified]
- **Remaining**: [items left for the next stage to handle]
```

#### Handoff Rules

1. **Lead reads previous handoff BEFORE spawning next stage's agents.** The handoff content is included in the next stage's agent spawn prompts, ensuring agents start with full context.
2. **Handoffs accumulate.** The verify stage can read all prior handoffs (plan → prd → exec) for full decision history.
3. **On team cancellation, handoffs survive** in `.omc/handoffs/` for session resume. They are not deleted by native Claude Code team cleanup; no `TeamDelete` call exists in Claude Code 2.1.178+.
4. **Handoffs are lightweight.** 10-20 lines max. They capture decisions and rationale, not full specifications (those live in deliverable files like DESIGN.md).

#### Example

```markdown
## Handoff: team-plan → team-exec

- **Decided**: Microservice architecture with 3 services (auth, api, worker). PostgreSQL for persistence. JWT for auth tokens.
- **Rejected**: Monolith (scaling concerns), MongoDB (team expertise is SQL), session cookies (API-first design).
- **Risks**: Worker service needs Redis for job queue — not yet provisioned. Auth service has no rate limiting in initial design.
- **Files**: DESIGN.md, TEST_STRATEGY.md
- **Remaining**: Database migration scripts, CI/CD pipeline config, Redis provisioning.
```

### Resume and Cancel Semantics

- **Resume:** restart from the last non-terminal stage using staged state + live task status. Read `.omc/handoffs/` to recover stage transition context.
- **Cancel:** use the authoritative flow in
  `skills/cancel/SKILL.md`; do not duplicate its flag, scope, or state-cleanup
  rules here. Handoff files in `.omc/handoffs/` are preserved for resume.
- Terminal states are `complete`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

## Windows psmux tmux-compatible gate

On native Windows, do **not** tell users that `/team` requires WSL or that tmux is unavailable until the actual tmux-compatible binary has been checked. Native [psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux) installs a `tmux`-compatible command (often `tmux` / `tmux.cmd`) and is a supported Team multiplexer.

Before blocking or falling back on Windows:

1. Check `tmux -V` (or the platform equivalent such as `where tmux` followed by `tmux -V`).
2. Treat a successful psmux-backed `tmux -V` as tmux available.
3. If psmux/tmux is available, continue the normal Team flow; do not emit WSL-required guidance.
4. Only when no tmux-compatible binary is available, tell the user to install psmux for native Windows support or use WSL2 as an alternative.

## Workflow

### Resume Check (Before Initialization)

Resolve the current session identity from the invocation context before touching Team state. In CLI contexts, `OMC_SESSION_ID` is authoritative; in hook contexts, the payload's `session_id` is authoritative. When an identity is available, pass it explicitly and consistently:

```
state_read(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>")
```

`state_read` without `session_id` reads legacy/aggregate state and may include other sessions. Never select or resume a Team from an unscoped aggregate response. If no identity is available, use only an explicitly identified legacy state; never infer ownership from session entries in an aggregate response.

Read existing session state before deriving a slug, decomposing work, or writing/initializing state. If `active=true` and `current_phase` is non-terminal, resume the recorded stage using the existing handoffs and task-list state for that Team. Preserve `team_name`, `current_phase`, `fix_loop_count`, `max_fix_loops`, `stage_history`, and all other existing Team state fields, including worker/task/launch-attempt records. Use the same `session_id` on every subsequent `state_write` and `state_clear`, applying only partial updates under the existing state lock. Do not run the new-team initialization below, derive a replacement slug, create duplicate tasks, spawn duplicate workers, or repeat launch attempts.

If state is malformed, unreadable, or otherwise corrupt, report the diagnostic and preserve the original bytes. Do not replace, clear, initialize, or treat it as a new run.

The following initialization phases apply only to a new run with no active, scoped state.

### Phase 1: Parse Input

- Extract **N** (agent count), validate 1-20
- Extract **agent-type**, validate it maps to a known OMC subagent
- Extract **task** description

### Phase 2: Analyze & Decompose

Use `explore` or `architect` (via MCP or agent) to analyze the codebase and break the task into N subtasks:

- Each subtask should be **file-scoped** or **module-scoped** to avoid conflicts
- Subtasks must be independent or have clear dependency ordering
- Each subtask needs a concise `subject` and detailed `description`
- Identify dependencies between subtasks (e.g., "shared types must be fixed before consumers")

### Phase 3: Initialize Team State

Use the session's implicit Claude Code team. Do **not** call `TeamCreate`; Claude Code 2.1.178+ removed that tool and automatically gives the session one implicit team when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is enabled.

Derive a slug such as `fix-ts-errors` for OMC state, prompt labels, handoffs, and human-readable reporting only. Native Claude Code may accept `team_name` as legacy metadata, but it is ignored for routing.

Write OMC state using the `state_write` MCP tool for proper session-scoped persistence:

Use the same resolved `session_id` from the Resume Check for this and every later Team state call; if no identity is available, use only the explicitly identified legacy state described above.

```
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", active=true, current_phase="team-plan", state={
  "team_name": "fix-ts-errors",
  "agent_count": 3,
  "agent_types": "executor",
  "task": "fix all TypeScript errors",
  "fix_loop_count": 0,
  "max_fix_loops": 3,
  "linked_ralph": false,
  "stage_history": "team-plan"
})
```

> **Note:** The MCP `state_write` tool transports all values as strings. Consumers must coerce `agent_count`, `fix_loop_count`, `max_fix_loops` to numbers and `linked_ralph` to boolean when reading state.

**State schema fields:**

| Field            | Type    | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `active`         | boolean | Whether team mode is active                                                             |
| `current_phase`  | string  | Current pipeline stage: `team-plan`, `team-prd`, `team-exec`, `team-verify`, `team-fix` |
| `team_name`      | string  | OMC slug for state, handoffs, and reporting; ignored by native Claude Code routing |
| `agent_count`    | number  | Number of worker agents                                                                 |
| `agent_types`    | string  | Comma-separated agent types used in team-exec                                           |
| `task`           | string  | Original task description                                                               |
| `fix_loop_count` | number  | Current fix iteration count                                                             |
| `max_fix_loops`  | number  | Maximum fix iterations before failing (default: 3)                                      |
| `linked_ralph`   | boolean | Whether team is linked to a ralph persistence loop                                      |
| `stage_history`  | string  | Comma-separated list of stage transitions with timestamps                               |

**Update state on every stage transition:**

```
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", current_phase="team-exec", state={
  "stage_history": "team-plan:2026-02-07T12:00:00Z,team-prd:2026-02-07T12:01:00Z,team-exec:2026-02-07T12:02:00Z"
})
```

### Phase 4: Create Tasks

Create task list entries for each subtask using TodoWrite or the active task-list surface. Task-list tools are for tracking only; they do not create native teams.

```json
// Task-list entry for subtask 1
{
  "subject": "Fix type errors in src/auth/",
  "description": "Fix all TypeScript errors in src/auth/login.ts, src/auth/session.ts, and src/auth/types.ts. Run tsc --noEmit to verify.",
  "activeForm": "Fixing auth type errors"
}
```

**Response stores a task file (e.g. `1.json`):**

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "subject": "Fix type errors in src/auth/",
  "description": "Fix all TypeScript errors in src/auth/login.ts...",
  "activeForm": "Fixing auth type errors",
  "owner": "",
  "status": "pending",
  "blocks": [],
  "blockedBy": []
}
```

For tasks with dependencies, update the active task-list entries after creation:

```json
// Task #3 depends on task #1 (shared types must be fixed first)
{
  "taskId": "3",
  "addBlockedBy": ["1"]
}
```

**Pre-assign owners from the lead** to avoid race conditions (there is no atomic claiming):

```json
// Assign task #1 to worker-1
{
  "taskId": "1",
  "owner": "worker-1"
}
```

### Phase 5: Spawn Teammates

Spawn N teammates directly using the Agent/Task tool with distinct `name` values. Each teammate gets the team worker preamble (see below) plus their specific assignment. Do **not** call `TeamCreate`, and do **not** rely on `team_name`; Claude Code 2.1.178+ ignores it for native routing.

```json
{
  "subagent_type": "oh-my-claudecode:executor",
  "name": "worker-1",
  "prompt": "<worker-preamble + assigned tasks>"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "agent_id": "worker-1",
  "name": "worker-1"
}
```

**Side effects:**

- Teammate is spawned into the session's implicit Claude Code team
- An **internal task** is auto-created (with `metadata._internal: true`) tracking the agent lifecycle
- Internal tasks may appear in task-list output -- filter them when counting real tasks

**IMPORTANT:** Spawn all teammates in parallel (they are background agents). Do NOT wait for one to finish before spawning the next.

### Phase 6: Monitor

The lead orchestrator monitors progress through two channels:

1. **Inbound messages** -- Teammates message `team-lead` when they complete tasks or need help. These arrive through the active team/conversation surface.

2. **Task-list polling/review** -- Periodically check TodoWrite or the active task-list surface for overall progress:
   ```
   #1 [completed] Fix type errors in src/auth/ (worker-1)
   #3 [in_progress] Fix type errors in src/api/ (worker-2)
   #5 [pending] Fix type errors in src/utils/ (worker-3)
   ```
   Format: `#ID [status] subject (owner)`

**Coordination actions the lead can take:**

- **Unblock a teammate:** Send a message with guidance or missing context through the active team surface
- **Reassign work:** If a teammate finishes early, update the task-list entry to assign pending work to them and notify through the active team surface
- **Handle failures:** If a teammate reports failure, reassign the task or spawn a replacement

#### Task Watchdog Policy

Monitor for stuck or failed teammates:

- **Max in-progress age**: If a task stays `in_progress` for more than 5 minutes without messages, send a status check
- **Suspected dead worker**: No messages + stuck task for 10+ minutes → reassign task to another worker
- **Reassign threshold**: If a worker fails 2+ tasks, stop assigning new tasks to it

### Phase 6.5: Stage Transitions (State Persistence)

On every stage transition, update OMC state:

```
// Entering team-exec after planning
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", current_phase="team-exec", state={
  "stage_history": "team-plan:T1,team-prd:T2,team-exec:T3"
})

// Entering team-verify after execution
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", current_phase="team-verify")

// Entering team-fix after verify failure
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", current_phase="team-fix", state={
  "fix_loop_count": 1
})
```

This enables:

- **Resume**: If the lead crashes, `state_read(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>")` reveals the last stage and team name for recovery
- **Cancel**: The cancel skill reads `current_phase` to know what cleanup is needed
- **Ralph integration**: Ralph can read team state to know if the pipeline completed or failed

### Phase 7: Completion

When all real tasks (non-internal) are completed or failed:

1. **Verify results** -- Check that all real tasks (non-internal) are marked `completed` in TodoWrite or the active task-list surface
2. **Shutdown teammates** -- Send `shutdown_request` to each active teammate through the active team surface:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "shutdown_request",
     "recipient": "worker-1",
     "content": "All work complete, shutting down team"
   }
   ```
3. **Await responses** -- Each teammate responds with `shutdown_response(approve: true)` and terminates
4. **Clean up** -- After the graceful shutdown pass, follow the Team flow in
   `skills/cancel/SKILL.md` for the selected session and any linked Ralph;
   native Claude Code 2.1.178+ has no `TeamDelete`.
5. **Report summary** -- Present results to the user

## Agent Preamble

When spawning teammates, include this preamble in the prompt to establish the work protocol. Adapt it per teammate with their specific task assignments.

```
You are a TEAM WORKER in OMC team "{team_name}". Your name is "{worker_name}".
You report to the team lead ("team-lead").
You are not the leader and must not perform leader orchestration actions.

== WORK PROTOCOL ==

1. CLAIM: Check TodoWrite or the active task-list surface for tasks assigned to you (owner = "{worker_name}").
   Pick the first task with status "pending" that is assigned to you.
   Mark it `in_progress` using the active task-list surface:
   {"taskId": "ID", "status": "in_progress", "owner": "{worker_name}"}

2. WORK: Execute the task using your tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash).
   Do NOT spawn sub-agents. Do NOT delegate. Work directly.

3. COMPLETE: When done, mark the task completed:
   {"taskId": "ID", "status": "completed"}

4. REPORT: Notify the lead through the active team/conversation surface:
   {"type": "message", "recipient": "team-lead", "content": "Completed task #ID: <summary of what was done>", "summary": "Task #ID complete"}

5. NEXT: Check TodoWrite or the active task-list surface for more assigned tasks. If you have more pending tasks, go to step 1.
   If no more tasks are assigned to you, notify the lead through the active team/conversation surface:
   {"type": "message", "recipient": "team-lead", "content": "All assigned tasks complete. Standing by.", "summary": "All tasks done, standing by"}

6. SHUTDOWN: When you receive a shutdown_request, respond with:
   {"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "<from the request>", "approve": true}

== BLOCKED TASKS ==
If a task has blockedBy dependencies, skip it until those tasks are completed.
Check TodoWrite or the active task-list surface periodically to see if blockers have been resolved.

== ERRORS ==
If you cannot complete a task, report the failure to the lead:
{"type": "message", "recipient": "team-lead", "content": "FAILED task #ID: <reason>", "summary": "Task #ID failed"}
Do NOT mark the task as completed. Leave it in_progress so the lead can reassign.

== RULES ==
- NEVER spawn sub-agents or use the Task tool
- NEVER run tmux pane/session orchestration commands (for example `tmux split-window`, `tmux new-session`)
- NEVER run team spawning/orchestration skills or commands (for example `$team`, `$autopilot`, `$ralph`, `omc team ...`, `omx team ...`)
- ALWAYS use absolute file paths
- ALWAYS report progress to "team-lead" through the active team/conversation surface
- Use direct team/conversation messages with type "message" only -- never "broadcast"
```

### Agent-Type Prompt Injection (Worker-Specific Addendum)

When composing teammate prompts, append a short addendum based on worker type:

- `claude_worker`: Emphasize strict TodoWrite/task-list updates, active team/conversation messages, and no orchestration commands.
- `codex_worker`: Emphasize CLI API lifecycle (`omc team api ... --json`) and explicit failure ACKs with stderr.
- `gemini_worker`: Emphasize bounded file ownership and milestone ACKs after each completed sub-step.
- `antigravity_worker`: Same expectations as `gemini_worker`; emphasize bounded file ownership and milestone ACKs after each completed sub-step.

This addendum must preserve the core rule: **worker = executor only, never leader/orchestrator**.

## Communication Patterns

### Teammate to Lead (task completion report)

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "team-lead",
  "content": "Completed task #1: Fixed 3 type errors in src/auth/login.ts and 2 in src/auth/session.ts. All files pass tsc --noEmit.",
  "summary": "Task #1 complete"
}
```

### Lead to Teammate (reassignment or guidance)

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "recipient": "worker-2",
  "content": "Task #3 is now unblocked. Also pick up task #5 which was originally assigned to worker-1.",
  "summary": "New task assignment"
}
```

### Broadcast (use sparingly -- sends N separate messages)

```json
{
  "type": "broadcast",
  "content": "STOP: shared types in src/types/index.ts have changed. Pull latest before continuing.",
  "summary": "Shared types changed"
}
```

### Shutdown Protocol (BLOCKING)

**CRITICAL for graceful paths:** Execute these steps in order. Never clear OMC
Team state before shutdown is confirmed or timed out. The `--force` and
`--force --all` invocations are the explicit wait-skipping paths; they still
use the canonical protected, session-scoped clear, honor locks/ownership, and
report failures. `--force` alone never broadens scope.

**Step 1: Verify completion**

```
Verify via TodoWrite or the active task-list surface — all real tasks (non-internal) are completed or failed.
```

**Step 2: Request shutdown from each teammate**

**Lead sends:**

```json
{
  "type": "shutdown_request",
  "recipient": "worker-1",
  "content": "All work complete, shutting down team"
}
```

**Step 3: Wait for responses (BLOCKING)**

- Follow the canonical cancel flow: wait up to 15 seconds per teammate for
  `shutdown_response`, then reconcile for 5 more seconds
- Track which teammates confirmed vs timed out
- If a teammate doesn't respond after those waits: log warning, mark as unresponsive

**Teammate receives and responds:**

```json
{
  "type": "shutdown_response",
  "request_id": "shutdown-1770428632375@worker-1",
  "approve": true
}
```

After approval, the teammate terminates or stops accepting new work. Claude Code 2.1.178+ does not expose per-team config membership or TeamDelete cleanup; track acknowledgements in OMC state/reporting instead.

**Step 4: Complete protected cleanup**

After the graceful pass, follow the Team cancellation flow in
`skills/cancel/SKILL.md`; it clears the selected session and handles linked
Ralph. Claude Code 2.1.178+ has no `TeamDelete`.

**Step 5: Orphan scan for OMC tmux/CLI workers only**

For legacy OMC tmux/CLI worker runs (`omc team` / `/omc-teams`), check for worker processes that survived cleanup:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cleanup-orphans.mjs" --team-name fix-ts-errors
```

This scans for OMC worker processes matching the team name and terminates stale orphans (SIGTERM → 5s wait → SIGKILL). Supports `--dry-run` for inspection.

The graceful clear requires every teammate to confirm (`shutdown_response`
with `approve: true`) or time out. The `request_id` comes from the request;
teammates must return it, never fabricate one.

## CLI Workers (Codex and Gemini)

The team skill supports **hybrid execution** combining Claude agent teammates with external CLI workers (Codex CLI and Gemini CLI). Both types can make code changes -- they differ in capabilities and cost. These are standalone CLI tools, not MCP servers.

### Execution Modes

Tasks are tagged with an execution mode during decomposition:

| Execution Mode  | Provider               | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `claude_worker` | Claude agent           | Full Claude Code tool access (Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Task). Best for tasks needing Claude's reasoning + iterative tool use.                                                                  |
| `codex_worker`  | Codex CLI (tmux pane)  | Full filesystem access in working_directory. Runs autonomously via tmux pane. Best for code review, security analysis, refactoring, architecture. Requires `npm install -g @openai/codex`. |
| `gemini_worker`      | Gemini CLI (tmux pane)      | Full filesystem access in working_directory. Runs autonomously via tmux pane. Best for UI/design work, documentation, large-context tasks. Requires `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` (enterprise/API-key tier). |
| `antigravity_worker` | Antigravity CLI (tmux pane) | Full filesystem access in working_directory. Runs autonomously via tmux pane. Same strengths as gemini_worker; Google's successor to the Gemini CLI. Install per the [official instructions](https://antigravity.google) (`agy` binary). |

### How CLI Workers Operate

Tmux CLI workers run in dedicated tmux panes with filesystem access. They are **autonomous executors**, not just analysts:

1. Lead writes task instructions to a prompt file
2. Lead spawns a tmux CLI worker with `working_directory` set to the project root
3. The worker reads files, makes changes, runs commands -- all within the working directory
4. Results/summary are written to an output file
5. Lead reads the output, marks the task complete, and feeds results to dependent tasks

**Key difference from Claude teammates:**

- CLI workers operate via tmux, not Claude Code's tool system
- They cannot use Claude Code's native task-list or team messaging surfaces
- Codex, Gemini, Grok, Antigravity, and Claude CLI workers record the assigned task's terminal state and exit
- Cursor workers stay in the interactive session, wait for mailbox messages, and exit only on an explicit shutdown. Cursor reviewer task transitions stay with the leader
- The lead manages their lifecycle (spawn, monitor, collect results)

### Cursor/Codex startup evidence timeout

The v2 runtime waits up to 30 seconds for current-attempt task/status evidence. If that is absent, a read-only pane activity probe can grant a busy Cursor/Codex worker one additional 30-second evidence window. An idle, dead, or unverified pane gets only the normal 1-second final recheck. The trigger is never resent, and pane activity alone never counts as successful startup. A busy pane that still has no current-attempt evidence fails as `worker_startup_evidence_missing_pane_busy`; every other miss stays `worker_startup_evidence_missing`. That startup failure reads the owned pane once, joins wrapped tmux lines, and keeps one claim-task error line when the capture contains it. The line is not startup evidence, and other misses do not read the pane.

The default busy-worker evidence budget is therefore 60 seconds, plus probe and evidence-read overhead (roughly a minute, not a hard 61-second wall-clock limit). Pane creation, readiness, and cleanup add separate time. Startup is serial, so these waits can accumulate per worker. `OMC_TEAM_ENGAGED_PANE_RECHECK_MS` overrides the additional window in milliseconds; positive values are capped at 120000, while invalid or non-positive values retain the default.

### When to Route Where

| Task Type                        | Best Route                     | Why                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Iterative multi-step work        | Claude teammate                | Needs tool-mediated iteration + team communication  |
| Code review / security audit     | CLI worker or specialist agent | Autonomous execution, good at structured analysis   |
| Architecture analysis / planning | architect Claude agent         | Strong analytical reasoning with codebase access    |
| Refactoring (well-scoped)        | CLI worker or executor agent   | Autonomous execution, good at structured transforms |
| UI/frontend implementation       | designer Claude agent          | Design expertise, framework idioms                  |
| Large-scale documentation        | writer Claude agent            | Writing expertise + large context for consistency   |
| Build/test iteration loops       | Claude teammate                | Needs Bash tool + iterative fix cycles              |
| Tasks needing team coordination  | Claude teammate                | Needs team/conversation status updates              |

### Example: Hybrid Team with CLI Workers

```
/team 3:executor "refactor auth module with security review"

Task decomposition:
#1 [codex_worker] Security review of current auth code -> output to .omc/research/auth-security.md
#2 [codex_worker] Refactor auth/login.ts and auth/session.ts (uses #1 findings)
#3 [claude_worker:designer] Redesign auth UI components (login form, session indicator)
#4 [claude_worker] Update auth tests + fix integration issues
#5 [gemini_worker] Final code review of all changes
```

The lead runs #1 (Codex security analysis), then #2 and #3 in parallel (Codex refactors backend, designer agent redesigns frontend), then #4 (Claude teammate handles test iteration), then #5 (Gemini final review).

### Pre-flight Analysis (Optional)

For large ambiguous tasks, run analysis before team creation:

1. Spawn `Task(subagent_type="oh-my-claudecode:planner", ...)` with task description + codebase context
2. Use the analysis to produce better task decomposition
3. Create team and tasks with enriched context

This is especially useful when the task scope is unclear and benefits from external reasoning before committing to a specific decomposition.

## Monitor Enhancement: Outbox Auto-Ingestion

The lead can proactively ingest outbox messages from CLI workers using the outbox reader utilities, enabling event-driven monitoring alongside native team/conversation delivery.

### Outbox Reader Functions

**`readNewOutboxMessages(teamName, workerName)`** -- Read new outbox messages for a single worker using a byte-offset cursor. Each call advances the cursor, so subsequent calls only return messages written since the last read. Mirrors the inbox cursor pattern from `readNewInboxMessages()`.

**`readAllTeamOutboxMessages(teamName)`** -- Read new outbox messages from ALL workers in a team. Returns an array of `{ workerName, messages }` entries, skipping workers with no new messages. Useful for batch polling in the monitor loop.

**`resetOutboxCursor(teamName, workerName)`** -- Reset the outbox cursor for a worker back to byte 0. Useful when re-reading historical messages after a lead restart or for debugging.

### Using `getTeamStatus()` in the Monitor Phase

The `getTeamStatus(teamName, workingDirectory, heartbeatMaxAgeMs?)` function provides a unified snapshot combining:

- **Worker registration** -- Which MCP workers are registered (from shadow registry / config.json)
- **Heartbeat freshness** -- Whether each worker is alive based on heartbeat age
- **Task progress** -- Per-worker and team-wide task counts (pending, in_progress, completed)
- **Current task** -- Which task each worker is actively executing
- **Recent outbox messages** -- New messages since the last status check

Example usage in the monitor loop:

```typescript
const status = getTeamStatus("fix-ts-errors", workingDirectory);

for (const worker of status.workers) {
  if (!worker.isAlive) {
    // Worker is dead -- reassign its in-progress tasks
  }
  for (const msg of worker.recentMessages) {
    if (msg.type === "task_complete") {
      // Mark task complete, unblock dependents
    } else if (msg.type === "task_failed") {
      // Handle failure, possibly retry or reassign
    } else if (msg.type === "error") {
      // Log error, check if worker needs intervention
    }
  }
}

if (status.taskSummary.pending === 0 && status.taskSummary.inProgress === 0) {
  // All work done -- proceed to shutdown
}
```

### Event-Based Actions from Outbox Messages

| Message Type    | Action                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_complete` | Mark task completed, check if blocked tasks are now unblocked, notify dependent workers     |
| `task_failed`   | Increment failure sidecar, decide retry vs reassign vs skip                                 |
| `idle`          | Worker has no assigned tasks -- assign pending work or begin shutdown                       |
| `error`         | Log the error, check `consecutiveErrors` in heartbeat for quarantine threshold              |
| `shutdown_ack`  | Worker acknowledged shutdown -- safe to remove from team                                    |
| `heartbeat`     | Update liveness tracking (redundant with heartbeat files but useful for latency monitoring) |

This approach complements native team/conversation messaging by providing a pull-based mechanism for MCP workers that cannot use Claude Code's team messaging tools.

## Error Handling

### Teammate Fails a Task

1. Teammate reports the failure to the lead through the active team/conversation surface
2. Lead decides: retry (reassign same task to same or different worker) or skip
3. To reassign: update the active task-list entry with the new owner, then message the new owner through the active team surface

### Teammate Gets Stuck (No Messages)

1. Lead detects via TodoWrite or the active task-list surface -- task stuck in `in_progress` for too long
2. Lead messages the teammate asking for status through the active team surface
3. If no response, consider the teammate dead
4. Reassign the task to another worker through the active task-list surface

### Dependency Blocked

1. If a blocking task fails, the lead must decide whether to:
   - Retry the blocker
   - Remove the dependency by updating the active task-list entry's `blockedBy` metadata
   - Skip the blocked task entirely
2. Communicate decisions to affected teammates through the active team surface

### Teammate Crashes

1. Internal tracking for that teammate will show unexpected status
2. Lead reassigns orphaned tasks to remaining workers
3. If needed, spawn a replacement teammate with `Task(name="worker-N", subagent_type="...")`

## Team + Ralph Composition

When the user invokes `/team ralph`, says "team ralph", or combines both keywords, team mode wraps itself in Ralph's persistence loop. This provides:

- **Team orchestration** -- multi-agent staged pipeline with specialized agents per stage
- **Ralph persistence** -- retry on failure, architect verification before completion, iteration tracking

### Activation

Team+Ralph activates when:

1. User invokes `/team ralph "task"` or `/oh-my-claudecode:team ralph "task"`
2. Keyword detector finds both `team` and `ralph` in the prompt
3. Hook detects `MAGIC KEYWORD: RALPH` alongside team context

### State Linkage

Both modes write their own state files with cross-references:

```
// Team state (via state_write)
state_write(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>", active=true, current_phase="team-plan", state={
  "team_name": "build-rest-api",
  "linked_ralph": true,
  "task": "build a complete REST API"
})

// Ralph state (via state_write)
state_write(mode="ralph", session_id="<current_session_id>", active=true, iteration=1, max_iterations=10, current_phase="execution", state={
  "linked_team": true,
  "team_name": "build-rest-api"
})
```

### Execution Flow

1. Ralph outer loop starts (iteration 1)
2. Team pipeline runs: `team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify`
3. If `team-verify` passes: Ralph runs architect verification (STANDARD tier minimum)
4. If architect approves: both modes complete, run `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel`
5. If `team-verify` fails OR architect rejects: team enters `team-fix`, then loops back to `team-exec -> team-verify`
6. If fix loop exceeds `max_fix_loops`: Ralph increments iteration and retries the full pipeline
7. If Ralph exceeds `max_iterations`: terminal `failed` state

## Idempotent Recovery

If the lead crashes mid-run, the team skill should detect existing OMC state and resume:

1. Read `state_read(mode="team", session_id="<current_session_id>")` for the active OMC team slug, phase, and worker labels
2. Use OMC handoffs and task-list/TodoWrite state to determine current progress
3. Resume monitor mode instead of spawning duplicate teammates
4. Continue from the last recorded stage

This prevents duplicate worker spawns and allows graceful recovery from lead failures.

## Comparison: Team vs Legacy Swarm

| Aspect                  | Team (Native Claude Code 2.1.178+)                              | Swarm (Legacy SQLite)                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**             | OMC state/handoffs plus Claude Code's current task-list surface   | SQLite in `.omc/state/swarm.db`        |
| **Dependencies**        | `better-sqlite3` not needed                                      | Requires `better-sqlite3` npm package  |
| **Task claiming**       | Lead pre-assigns named workers through task-list/TodoWrite state  | SQLite IMMEDIATE transaction -- atomic |
| **Race conditions**     | Possible if two agents claim same task (mitigate by pre-assigning) | None (SQLite transactions)             |
| **Communication**       | Native implicit-team messages / conversation turns                | None (fire-and-forget agents)          |
| **Task dependencies**   | Lead-managed dependencies in task-list/TodoWrite state            | Not supported                          |
| **Heartbeat**           | Lead detects via missing messages/status                          | Manual heartbeat table + polling       |
| **Shutdown**            | Graceful request/response protocol plus OMC state clear           | Signal-based termination               |
| **Agent lifecycle**     | Tracked by named Agent/Task spawns and OMC state                  | Manual tracking via heartbeat table    |
| **Progress visibility** | Task list/TodoWrite state with named worker ownership             | SQL queries on tasks table             |
| **Conflict prevention** | Owner labels (lead-assigned)                                      | Lease-based claiming with timeout      |
| **Crash recovery**      | Lead detects via missing messages, reassigns                      | Auto-release after 5-min lease timeout |
| **State cleanup**       | Clear OMC team state after teammate shutdown                      | Manual `rm` of SQLite database         |

**When to use Team over Swarm:** Always prefer `/team` for new native Claude Code work. It uses Claude Code's implicit agent team, requires no external dependencies, supports inter-agent coordination, and has task dependency management.

## Cancellation

Team cancellation is defined only by the flow in
`skills/cancel/SKILL.md`. It owns the flag matrix, identity/fail-closed rule,
graceful and forced waits, session-scoped protected clears, Team-first linked
Ralph handling, all-session authorization, and unresolved-session gate.
Handoffs survive cancellation; uncaptured Team roots remain protected.

### Linked Mode Cancellation (Team + Ralph)

The linked-Ralph dependency is covered by that same canonical flow; do not
restate a second session-operation recipe here.

## Runtime V2 (Event-Driven)

By default, the team runtime uses an event-driven architecture instead of the legacy done.json polling watchdog:

- **No done.json**: Task completion is detected via CLI API lifecycle transitions (claim-task, transition-task-status)
- **Snapshot-based monitoring**: Each poll cycle takes a point-in-time snapshot of tasks and workers, computes deltas, and emits events
- **Event log**: All team events are appended to `.omc/state/team/{teamName}/events.jsonl`
- **Worker status files**: Workers write status to `.omc/state/team/{teamName}/workers/{name}/status.json`
- **Preserved**: Sentinel gate (blocks premature completion), circuit breaker (dead worker detection), failure sidecars

Native CLI team jobs require the instance-bound v2 runtime. Unset a disabling
`OMC_RUNTIME_V2` value (`0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`) before starting them; there is
no pane-only legacy cleanup fallback. Shutdown requires matching instance and
worker-launch evidence even with `--force`. Session `state_clear` does not remove
native runtime trees or substitute for native team shutdown.

## Dynamic Scaling

When `OMC_TEAM_SCALING_ENABLED=1` is set, the team supports mid-session scaling:

- **scale_up**: Add workers to a running team (respects max_workers limit)
- **scale_down**: Remove idle workers with graceful drain (workers finish current task before removal)
- File-based scaling lock prevents concurrent scale operations
- Monotonic worker index counter ensures unique worker names across scale events

## Configuration

Optional settings live in `.claude/omc.jsonc` (project) or `~/.config/claude-omc/config.jsonc` (user). Project values override user values; `OMC_TEAM_ROLE_OVERRIDES` (env JSON) supersedes both.

```jsonc
{
  "team": {
    "ops": {
      "maxAgents": 20,
      "defaultAgentType": "claude",
      "monitorIntervalMs": 30000,
      "shutdownTimeoutMs": 15000,
    },
  },
}
```

- **ops.maxAgents** - Maximum teammates (default: 20)
- **ops.defaultAgentType** - CLI provider when a `/team` invocation does not specify one (`claude` | `codex` | `gemini` | `antigravity` | `grok` | `cursor`, default: `claude`)
- **ops.monitorIntervalMs** - How often to review TodoWrite or the active task-list surface (default: 30s)
- **ops.shutdownTimeoutMs** - How long to wait for shutdown responses (default: 15s)

> **Note:** Native Claude Code teammates do not have a hardcoded model default; each teammate inherits the lead session's configured model unless overridden per role. OMC's legacy CLI workers are separate processes: their provider and model come from OMC's team routing, not native teammate inheritance.
>
> **Nesting (Claude Code 2.1.217+):** Claude teammates are full, independent Claude Code sessions in the session's implicit team (see Phase 5). Do not assume a teammate can or cannot spawn nested subagents: Claude Code 2.1.217–2.1.218 defaulted `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` to 1, while 2.1.219+ defaults to 3, and the current setting controls subagent layers below the main conversation. Plan each teammate as the unit that does the work unless nested delegation is deliberate and supported by the active runtime. OMC CLI workers (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `grok`, `cursor`, and `antigravity` via `ops.defaultAgentType`) are separate processes, not Claude Code subagents, and are unaffected by Claude's subagent depth setting.
>
> **Concurrency:** The current OMC team CLI caps worker fan-out at 20 (`MAX_WORKER_COUNT`); although `ops.maxAgents` exists in the config schema, the current launcher does not consult it. Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` also defaults to 20, but that limit applies to Agent-spawned subagents; Claude Code documents agent-team teammates as following their own limits. Do not treat the two values as a shared cap or assume a full-size OMC team leaves exactly zero headroom for ordinary subagents; size OMC teams conservatively when the lead also needs Agent-spawned work.

## Per-Role Provider & Model Routing

> **Scope:** Applies to `/team` only. Task-based delegation uses `delegationRouting` (see separate docs). The two systems coexist by design.

Declare which provider (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `antigravity`, `grok`, `cursor`) and which model tier should back each canonical role. Routing is resolved **once** at team creation and persisted in `TeamConfig.resolved_routing` — spawn, scale-up, and restart all read from the snapshot, so a role's worker CLI and model are stable for the lifetime of the team.

### Example — user target mapping

```jsonc
// .claude/omc.jsonc
{
  "team": {
    "roleRouting": {
      "orchestrator": { "model": "inherit" },
      "planner": { "provider": "claude", "model": "HIGH" },
      "analyst": { "provider": "claude", "model": "HIGH" },
      "executor": { "provider": "claude", "model": "MEDIUM" },
      "debugger": { "provider": "cursor" },
      "critic": { "provider": "codex" },
      "code-reviewer": { "provider": "gemini" },
      "test-engineer": { "provider": "gemini", "model": "MEDIUM" },
    },
  },
}
```

| Role            | Provider        | Model                     |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `orchestrator`  | claude (pinned) | inherits invoking session |
| `planner`       | claude          | `HIGH` (opus)             |
| `analyst`       | claude          | `HIGH` (opus)             |
| `executor`      | claude          | `MEDIUM` (sonnet)         |
| `debugger`      | cursor          | cursor-agent default      |
| `critic`        | codex           | codex default             |
| `code-reviewer` | gemini          | gemini default            |
| `test-engineer` | antigravity     | antigravity default       |

### Canonical roles

`orchestrator`, `planner`, `analyst`, `architect`, `executor`, `debugger`, `critic`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-engineer`, `designer`, `writer`, `code-simplifier`, `explore`, `document-specialist`.

User-friendly aliases normalize via `normalizeDelegationRole()` — e.g. `reviewer` → `code-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer` → `code-reviewer`, `harsh-critic` → `critic`, `build-fixer` → `debugger`. Accepted alias keys are honored during resolved snapshot creation and later stage routing, not just validation. Unknown roles fail validation at parse time.

### Spec fields (`TeamRoleAssignmentSpec`)

- **provider** — `"claude" | "codex" | "gemini" | "antigravity" | "grok" | "cursor"`. Omitted → defaults to `claude`.
- **model** — tier name (`"HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"`) or an explicit model ID. Tiers resolve through `routing.tierModels`.
- **agent** — optional Claude agent name (e.g. `"critic"`, `"executor"`). Only honored when the resolved provider is `claude`.

`orchestrator` is pinned to `claude`; only `model` is user-configurable. Any other key on `orchestrator` is rejected by the validator.

`cursor` launches `cursor-agent` as an interactive worker. Reviewer/verdict roles (`critic`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-engineer`) are supported and receive the same structured verdict-output contract as other non-Claude providers. The leader owns the terminal task transition after consuming the verdict; final approval remains a lead-session responsibility.

### Env override

```bash
OMC_TEAM_ROLE_OVERRIDES='{"critic":{"provider":"codex"},"code-reviewer":{"provider":"gemini"}}'
```

Precedence: `OMC_TEAM_ROLE_OVERRIDES` > `.claude/omc.jsonc` (project) > `~/.config/claude-omc/config.jsonc` (user) > built-in defaults. Invalid JSON logs a warning and is ignored — env overrides are best-effort and never abort the run.

### Missing CLI preflight

Team startup strictly preflights only providers that are effective for its initial workers, including idle-worker assignments and explicit role routes. Role routing selects each worker's initial startup provider; later tasks delivered to an existing pane keep that worker's provider and are not re-routed by task role. A missing, relative, or untrusted binary for a selected provider fails before team state or multiplexer side effects are created. Providers that are merely present in the routing snapshot or declared agent list, including providers for roles never selected for a launch, are not probed. Routing is authoritative: the runtime never silently changes a selected role to Claude when its provider is unavailable. Scale-up and worker recovery independently preflight the provider they are about to launch and fail closed if it is unavailable. Probe provider availability with `omc doctor --team-routing`.

### Stickiness — resolved once, reused everywhere

Resolved routing is immutable per team. It selects each worker's initial startup assignment; later tasks in an existing pane stay on that worker's provider instead of triggering task-role provider re-routing. Editing config mid-team-lifetime does not affect running teams; a new `/team` invocation picks up the new mapping. Spawn, scale-up, and worker-restart use the same snapshot for the workers they launch, including across worktree detaches (the snapshot travels with `TeamConfig`).

### Zero-config behavior

An empty `team.roleRouting` preserves pre-patch behavior: every worker is Claude, model tiers follow `routing.tierModels`, and `/team 3:executor ...` still spawns three Claude Sonnet executors.

## State Cleanup

Use `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` for Team and linked-Ralph cleanup; its
authoritative flow handles session identity, locks/ownership, graceful versus
forced waits, and legacy runtime cleanup. Native Claude Code 2.1.178+ has no
`TeamDelete`. For normal completion, invoke it after the shutdown protocol;
uncaptured Team roots and handoffs are preserved.

## Git Worktree Integration

MCP workers can operate in isolated git worktrees to prevent file conflicts between concurrent workers.

### How It Works

1. **Worktree creation**: Before spawning a worker, call `createWorkerWorktree(teamName, workerName, repoRoot)` to create an isolated worktree at `.omc/worktrees/{team}/{worker}` with branch `omc-team/{teamName}/{workerName}`.

2. **Worker isolation**: Pass the worktree path as the `workingDirectory` in the worker's `BridgeConfig`. The worker operates exclusively in its own worktree.

3. **Merge coordination**: After a worker completes its tasks, use `checkMergeConflicts()` to verify the branch can be cleanly merged, then `mergeWorkerBranch()` to merge with `--no-ff` for clear history.

4. **Team cleanup**: On team shutdown, call `cleanupTeamWorktrees(teamName, repoRoot)` to remove all worktrees and their branches.

### Important Notes

- `createSession()` in `tmux-session.ts` does NOT handle worktree creation — worktree lifecycle is managed separately via `git-worktree.ts`
- Worktrees are NOT cleaned up on individual worker shutdown — only on team shutdown, to allow post-mortem inspection
- Branch names are sanitized via `sanitizeName()` to prevent injection
- All paths are validated against directory traversal

## Gotchas

1. **Internal/lifecycle task entries may pollute task-list output** -- If Claude Code reports internal lifecycle entries for spawned teammates, filter them when counting real task progress. The subject of an internal task is often the teammate's name.

2. **No atomic claiming** -- Unlike SQLite swarm, native task-list/TodoWrite state does not provide transactional claiming. Two teammates could race to claim the same task. **Mitigation:** The lead should pre-assign owners before spawning teammates. Teammates should only work on tasks assigned to them.

3. **Task IDs are strings when exposed by task-list tools** -- IDs may be auto-incrementing strings ("1", "2", "3"), not integers. Always pass string values to `taskId` fields when using task-list tools.

4. **No TeamDelete cleanup** -- Claude Code 2.1.178+ removed `TeamDelete`; use shutdown messages plus OMC state cleanup.

5. **Messages are auto-delivered** -- Teammate messages arrive to the lead as new conversation turns. No polling or inbox-checking is needed for inbound messages. However, if the lead is mid-turn (processing), messages queue and deliver when the turn ends.

6. **Do not put secrets in teammate prompts** -- Prompts can be retained in logs, state, or conversation history. Keep credentials and sensitive data out of teammate prompts.

7. **Shutdown acknowledgements are state/reporting events** -- After a teammate approves shutdown and terminates, track that acknowledgement in OMC state/reporting. Do not expect a Claude Code team membership config to update.

8. **shutdown_response needs request_id** -- The teammate must extract the `request_id` from the incoming shutdown request JSON and pass it back. The format is `shutdown-{timestamp}@{worker-name}`. Fabricating this ID will cause the shutdown to fail silently.

9. **Team name must be a valid slug** -- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Derive from the task description (e.g., "fix TypeScript errors" becomes "fix-ts-errors").

10. **Broadcast is expensive** -- Each broadcast sends a separate message to every teammate. Use `message` (DM) by default. Only broadcast for truly team-wide critical alerts.

11. **CLI worker lifetime follows the provider** -- See How CLI Workers Operate. Tmux CLI workers do not use Claude Code's native task-list or team messaging surfaces.

## Parallel session caveats

- **Multi-repo workspace anchor:** drop a `.omc-workspace` marker at the parent directory so multiple sessions across sub-repos share one `.omc/`. Resolution order: `OMC_STATE_DIR > .omc-workspace > git > cwd`. See `docs/REFERENCE.md`.
- **Session id source:** OMC_SESSION_ID env var wins in CLI contexts; hook payload data.session_id wins in hook contexts.
- **Plan id (when applicable):** Team state is session-scoped. Team handoffs at `.omc/handoffs/` are shared by design (see Wave G in the workspace plan).
- **Parallel verdict:** supported (session-scoped + shared handoffs by design)
